Machine Learning Models to optimze revenue on short term rental properties
This project demonstrates a machine learning-based approach to optimize dynamic pricing strategies for individual short-term rental properties, using three rental properties as case studies. The technique involves developing and evaluating four models—logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, and support vector machines—to predict booking outcomes based on key factors such as booking lead time, nightly pricing, and seasonal demand. Grid search cross-validation is employed to identify the most accurate model, which is then calibrated to provide reliable booking proba-bility estimates. These calibrated probabilities are used to calculate the expected value of nightly revenue across a wide range of mar-ket conditions, offering a robust framework for property-specific pricing strategies that maximize annual revenue.
